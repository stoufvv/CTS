Title of the bachelor topic: Film Lab Management App
The film has many attributes, but not all of them are needed. Make sure that a user can add a film without mentioning all the attributes, but without giving them no value.

Advantages
- now you can explicitly assign values
- the implementation can need less attributes, so the user can provide less of them

Disadvantages
- a new builder has to be implemented if a new film type appears
- bugs can become serious if all values are needed
