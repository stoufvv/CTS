Title of the bachelor topic: Film Lab Management App

A manager wants to perform a number of operations on films that are added to the shop.
In order to have all the films a database query has to be performed and this takes up a lot of resources. 
For this to be made on every operation would be a lot of a waste of resources. 
The prototype pattern solves this issue by querying the data only one time.

Advantages
- you can operate fast
- it is efficient for the memory

Disadvantages
- updates on the db are not registered after the intial query so the solution will use the older version
- we make shallow copies
